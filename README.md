In order to exchange tokens on superswap, users need to authenticate themselves as shown in the demo above. Upon authentication, users can switch chains between bsc, eth(default) and polygon. Once a desired chain has been selected, users can select then select the tokens they wish to exchange by clicking on the token logo in the input fields.

After token selection, amounts can be input which will be automatically converted to the desired currency's amount, along with a gas fee estimat at the bottom. To complete the transaction, click the swap button and wait for your wallet to request approval to sign off on the transaction.
